# Telegram Remote Launcher
This bot allows you to start any software or file on your computer (and more soon), of course, just leave the script turned on on your PC!

## Setup
To install first of all you obviously need to install Python (tested version 3.8.2) (more information in the [wiki](https://github.com/Takabrycheri34/Telegram-Remote-Launcher/wiki/1%29-How-to-install%3F#installing-python))

The bot will install the dependencies on its own so just start it from the start.bat file.

### Common installation problems
Below are the errors that can commonly occur when installing the bot
#### Module 'pip' has no attribute 'main'

If you encounter this problem during the installation of the bot it means that pip is not updated, you can update it manually or run the fix.bat file, it will update pip and close by itself once finished then you can restart the bot!

## Config
